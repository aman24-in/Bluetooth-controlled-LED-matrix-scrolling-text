# Bluetooth-controlled-LED-matrix-scrolling-text
This repository contains files and circuit diagram for designing an 8*8 LED Matrix with Arduino Uno. It contains the program to control different aspects of LED Matrix.
***max 7219_circuit.png*** contains the circuit diagrams and connections.

***Arduino_BT_to_LED_Display*** === This program is specifically for led matrices which are joined end to end.

***Verticle Scroll*** === This program is specifically for led matrices which are lined upide down.

Read comment in programs carefully.
Library **MD_Parola** and **MD_MAX72XX** is used.
HC-05 bluetooth module s used in this project but it will work fine with HC-06 too.
